# Portable Arcade Cabinet

This is a arcade cabinet designed to be created on a CNC machine, ideally a Shop Bot.

### What does it look like?

### Why make this?  

* It's designed to work with 18mm plywood.
* It should allow for wheelchair access
* It fits a 21 inch 2018 iMac
* It has power cable access built into the face plate

#### Things I still want to change.
* As it is now, it is stable. That said, I want to add a vertical cross bar in a second edition to give it a hair more stability. I can sit on the desk now with my feet off the floor and it does not fall. I weight 140 pounds. I consider it stable enough to use as is but I will improve it in future. Also, I want to add a hanger for headphones. Finally, I want to tighten my tabs, they are a hair lose so I had to screw it together with L Brackets to make it really sturdy. In future, I'll eliminate them with tighter tabs.
